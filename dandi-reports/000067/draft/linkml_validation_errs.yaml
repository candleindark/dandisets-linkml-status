    description: "Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental
      role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during
      behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity
      in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population
      of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial
      prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales,
      sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated
      between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales,
      putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their
      dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond
      a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates.
      Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing
      pattern\u2013dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear
      effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets."

    description: "Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental
      role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during
      behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity
      in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population
      of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial
      prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales,
      sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated
      between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales,
      putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their
      dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond
      a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates.
      Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing
      pattern\u2013dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear
      effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets."

      role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during
      behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity
      in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population
      of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial
      prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales,
      sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated
      between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales,
      putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their
      dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond
      a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates.
      Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing
      pattern\u2013dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear
      effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets."

    description: "Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental
      role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during
      behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity
      in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population
      of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial
      prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales,
      sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated
      between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales,
      putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their
      dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond
      a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates.
      Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing
      pattern\u2013dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear
      effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets."

description: Simultaneous calcium imaging with Miniscopes and EEG/EMG experiment during
  retrospective memory-linking behavioral paradigm, to test whether ensemble co-reactivation
  is sleep-state specific. Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning
  and are stabilized by post-learning reactivation. Integrating recent experiences
  into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available
  information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear.
  Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble
  reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed
  2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral
  memory. Fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral
  memories across days. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the recent
  aversive memory ensemble is reactivated during the offline period after learning.
  However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive
  and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation
  occurs more during wake than during sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the
  neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the
  aversive and neutral memories. Collectively, these results demonstrate that offline
  ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism by which memories are integrated
  across days.

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

    description: "The Utah array powers cutting-edge projects for restoration of neurological
      function, such as BrainGate, but the underlying electrode technology has itself
      advanced little in the last three decades. Here, advanced dual-side lithographic
      microfabrication processes is exploited to demonstrate a 1024-channel penetrating
      silicon microneedle array (SiMNA) that is scalable in its recording capabilities
      and cortical coverage and is suitable for clinical translation. The SiMNA is
      the first penetrating microneedle array with a flexible backing that affords
      compliancy to brain movements. In addition, the SiMNA is optically transparent
      permitting simultaneous optical and electrophysiological interrogation of neuronal
      activity. The SiMNA is used to demonstrate reliable recordings of spontaneous
      and evoked field potentials and of single unit activity in chronically implanted
      mice for up to 196 days in response to optogenetic and to whisker air-puff stimuli.
      Significantly, the 1024-channel SiMNA establishes detailed spatiotemporal mapping
      of broadband brain activity in rats. This novel scalable and biocompatible SiMNA
      with its multimodal capability and sensitivity to broadband brain activity will
      accelerate the progress in fundamental neurophysiological investigations and
      establishes a new milestone for penetrating and large area coverage microelectrode
      arrays for brain\u2013machine interfaces."

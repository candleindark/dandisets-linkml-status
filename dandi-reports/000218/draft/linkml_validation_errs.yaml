    description: "The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs)
      have been studied extensively. Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical
      but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing
      patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of
      SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120\u2013180
      Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep,
      followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential
      (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are
      generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported
      by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent
      of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the
      magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly
      activated by SPW-Rs and may convey hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic
      and brainstem targets."

    description: "The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs)
      have been studied extensively. Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical
      but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing
      patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of
      SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120\u2013180
      Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep,
      followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential
      (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are
      generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported
      by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent
      of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the
      magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly
      activated by SPW-Rs and may convey hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic
      and brainstem targets."

    description: "The mnemonic functions of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs)
      have been studied extensively. Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical
      but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing
      patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of
      SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120\u2013180
      Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep,
      followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential
      (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are
      generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported
      by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent
      of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the
      magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly
      activated by SPW-Rs and may convey hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic
      and brainstem targets."

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
      of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0
      (NWB:N) has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level
      data together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next
      step to facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines
      to import/export data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset
      of 1863 single neurons recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects
      undergoing intracranial monitoring while they performed a recognition memory
      task. We provide code to analyze and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological
      recordings to/from NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant,
      which affords interoperability between programming languages and operating systems.
      This combined data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N
      for human single-neuron recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain
      data for both teaching and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing

      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

    description: Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important
      for offspring survival. Oxytocin which is released by the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity
      in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress. However, it
      is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling
      and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored
      the behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and
      litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from
      the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins
      were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins
      into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal
      retrieval, which activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting.
      Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing
      a mechanism for adapting the brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via
      endogenous oxytocin.

      nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity

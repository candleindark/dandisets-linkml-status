    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."

    description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
      relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity
      from interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage
      is unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal
      persistent activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude
      coupling (TG-PAC). We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and
      frontal lobe while patients maintained multiple items in their working memory.
      In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was indicative of working memory load and quality.
      We identified cells that selectively spiked during nonlinear interactions of
      theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated
      with frontal theta activity when cognitive control demand was high. By introducing
      noise correlations with persistently active neurons in the hippocampus, PAC
      neurons shaped the geometry of the population code. This led to higher-fidelity
      representations of working memory content that were associated with improved
      behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture of working memory,
      with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content in storage-related
      areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive control
      and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
      mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code
      that illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can
      be found here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote:
      sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing mean/std waveform data, but these
      data can be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."
